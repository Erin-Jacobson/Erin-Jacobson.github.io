			<p>When we are given a word problem in genetics, we can often use a Punnett Square to help us find the answer. Here we are working a problem regarding the gene for polydactyl cats.
				
				<br><br>Remember that polydactyl cats are cats that have extra toes.</p>
			
			<p><bold>Here is the problem we will be working with:</bold> Polydactyl cats have extra toes on their paws.  The polydactyl gene (P) is dominant to the normal gene (p).
				<br><br>
				
				If you cross a cat who is homozygous recessive for the polydactyl gene with a cat who is heterozygous, what are the possible phenotypes in the offspring?  What is the likelihood of each phenotype?</p>

			<p>As we know we will be using a Punnett Square to help us solve this problem, we will start by drawing a Punnett Square on our paper.
			<br><br>
			In the first lines, we are given the letter that we will be using to represent the dominant polydactyl allele (capital "P") and the letter for the recessive version of the gene, representing a normal number of toes (lowercase "p")
			<br><br>
			Next, looking at the main part of the problem, we see that we are crossing one parent who is HOMOZYGOUS RECESSIVE with another who is HETEROZYGOUS for the trait we are examining. Remember that homozygous means that this parent has two copies of the same allele, in this case recessive. Heterozygous means that the second parent has one copy of each allele, one capital and one lowercase.<br><br> Now we have the parent genotypes (Pp and pp).

		<div class="stepDescription">
			<p>We have already decoded the word problem to find our parent genotypes (Pp and pp). Now, we will write the parent genotypes on the outside of our Punnett square. <br><br>
			Write one parent on the left side of the box and the other parent on the top of the box. It does not matter which side has which parent; it is only important to remember that we never mix the parents.
			<br><br>Here I have shown both ways that this could be written. I will continue the problem with the arrangement shown on the left side, though you could use either arrangement and will come to the same final answer.

			<p>Fill in the Punnett Square with the alleles of the first parent. In this case, I am starting with the parent on the left (written in red). <br><br>
			First, both of the boxes on the first row will get a capital P, because this is what is available from the parent.
			<br><br>Second, the boxes on the second row will get a lowercase p, again because this is what was available--also known as what was written outside of the box.

			<p>Looking at our Punnett Square, we can now see all of the possible genotypes that we could get in the offspring of these two parents. <br><br>
			On top, highlighted in yellow, we see that there is a 2/4 (50%) chance of Pp.<br>On bottom, highlighted in green, we see that there is a 2/4 (50%) chance of pp.
			<br><br>Are we done? Sadly no. Pp and pp are GENOTYPES, not the PHENOTYPES that the problem requests. Genotypes are the types of genes (alleles) that an individual possesses. Phenotypes are the physical traits--such as whether a cat has extra toes.
			<br><br>Looking back at our word problem, we must remember that capital P represents the dominant polydactyl trait. If the offspring have any copies of capital P, they will be polydactyl. Our yellow highlighted portion of the Punnett Square will therefore represent a 2/4 (50%) chance of a polydactyl kitten.
			<br><br>The green highlighted portion of our Punnett Square shows only lowercase p's. As there are no copies of the dominant allele, we see instead the recessive trait. These boxes represent a 2/4 chance of getting a kitten with the normal number of toes.</p>
			
			<p class="warning">
			 <span class="material-icons">task_alt</span>
				Answer: there are two possible phenotypes in the offspring of this cross. </p>
			
			<ul class="warning"> 
				<li>Kittens could have either a normal number of toes or be polydactyl</li>
				<li>There is a 50% chance for either phenotype.</li>  
			</ul>
